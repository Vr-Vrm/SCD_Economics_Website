                    <p>This topic introduces the study of resource allocation under scarcity. Economic Methodology uses scientific methods to analyze economic issues. Nature and Purpose of Economic Activity focuses on meeting human needs and wants. Economic Resources include land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurship. Scarcity, Choice, and the Allocation of Resources highlight trade-offs and opportunity costs. Productivity Possibility Diagrams visually represent production trade-offs and efficiency frontiers.</p>

                    <p>This topic explores how prices are set through market forces. The Determinants of Demand include income, tastes, and prices of related goods. Price, Income, and Cross Elasticity of Demand measure responsiveness to changes. The Supply of Goods and Services depends on production costs and technology. Price Elasticity of Supply gauges supply responsiveness. The Determination of Equilibrium Market Prices occurs where supply equals demand. The Interrelationship between Markets shows how changes in one market affect others.</p>

Specialisation, Division of Labour, and Exchange enhance efficiency. The Law of Diminishing Returns and Returns to Scale affect output as inputs vary. Costs of Production include fixed and variable costs. Economies and Diseconomies of Scale influence cost efficiency. Marginal, Average, and Total Revenue guide pricing. Profit motivates firms. Technological Change boosts productivity.</p>

                    <p>This topic analyzes different market structures. Market Structures range from competitive to monopolistic. The Objectives of Firms often center on profit maximization. Perfect Competition features many firms with identical products. Monopoly and Monopsony Power involve single sellers or buyers dominating markets. The Advantages and Disadvantages of Monopoly weigh innovation against inefficiency. The Dynamics of Competition and Competitive Market Processes drive efficiency and consumer benefits.</p>

                    </ul>
                    <p>This section studies market efficiency and its limitations. How Markets and Prices Allocate Resources relies on supply and demand. The Meaning of Market Failure refers to inefficiencies like externalities. Private Goods, Public Goods, and Quasi-Public Goods differ in excludability and rivalry. Positive and Negative Externalities in Production and Consumption impact third parties. Merit and Demerit Goods are under- or over-consumed. Market Imperfections include information asymmetries. Government Intervention in Markets uses taxes or subsidies to correct failures. Government Failure occurs when interventions create inefficiencies.</p>
